# Exoplanetary
Habitable Range Exoplanet Star Map -- Interactive Web Application

Utilizes NASA's open exoplanet API to retrieve data on confirmed exoplanets in the observable universe. Filters to all relevant exoplanets based on whether they lie within the habitable range of their parent star. Renders the planets to the appropriate position in the "night sky" (app screen) based on declination and right ascension coordinates. 
Planets are interactive and give details regarding the planet. An elliptical orbit map also shows the relative speed of a planet's orbit around its parent star.
